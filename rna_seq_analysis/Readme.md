# Introduction

## Central dogma of molecular biology

We harbor a collection of DNA, RNA, protein, and metabolites from both human and microbial cells. DNA can provide instructions for proteins. During the expression of a protein-coding gene, the central dogma of molecular biology states that genetic information flows only in one direction, from DNA, to RNA, to protein, ultimately affecting the metabolite levels.

While performing microbiome data analysis, we collect microbiome samples and extract DNA for sequencing to uncover the potential capabilities of microbes by asking "Who are they?" and "What can they do?". However, the actual gene expression is reflected by transcription. Transcriptomics analysis involves isolation and purification of RNA from samples, followed by conversion from RNA to cDNA with reverse transcriptase. The cDNA is loaded in a sequencer and differential expressions are analysed.
